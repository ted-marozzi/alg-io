Our GitHub workflow is planned to be as follows:

To begin:
  
    git clone https://github.com/ted-marozzi/algo-io.git
    
    # Make sure you are in the repo folder
    cd algo-io
    
    # This pulls/copies the origin (Or remote master branch) to master 
    # (or local master)
    # and ensures the local master and origin master are in sync
    git pull origin master
    
    # This creates and moves onto a new feature branch
    git checkout -b username-feature


To use:

    # This pulls/copies the origin (Or remote master branch) to master 
    # (or local master)
    # and ensures the local master and origin master are in sync
    git pull origin master
    
    # This moves onto the feature branch you are working on
    git checkout username-feature
    
    # Make add and commit your changes with descriptive messages, 
    # when feature is done.
    git add .
    git commit -m "Descriptive"
    git push origin username-feature
    
    # Now wait for pull request to be reviewed and accepted or denyied.
    # If accepted make sure to, and just do it in general to stay up to date
